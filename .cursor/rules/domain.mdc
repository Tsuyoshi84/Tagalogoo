# Rules for domain logic

- Store business logic and rules in this directory.
- Do NOT import from `app/composables` or `app/stores`.
- Do NOT depend on the Vue reactivity system.
- Use clear and descriptive names.
- Add JSDoc comments. Put `@example` tags to illustrate usage if applicable.
- Provide unit tests.
