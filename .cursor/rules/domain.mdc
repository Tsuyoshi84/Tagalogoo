# Rules for domain logic

- Store business logic and rules in this directory.
- Do NOT import from `app/composables` or `app/stores`.
- Do NOT depend on the Vue reactivity system.
- Use clear and descriptive names.
- Add JSDoc comments. Put `@example` tags only for functions and mapped files to illustrate usage.
- If a function has a generic purpose and doesn't contain business logic, store it in `app/utils` or `shared/utils` instead.
- Functions should be pure (no side effects) and deterministic.
- Prefer composition over inheritance - break complex business logic into smaller, focused functions.
- Use TypeScript types from `shared/types` or `app/types` for domain-specific data structures.
- Provide unit tests with comprehensive coverage of business rules and edge cases.
